If you want to add art:

- SVG is preferred, because git can diff the result.
- You're free to apply a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike licence.  The GPL will preserve it.
- Make sure you're noted in the artists' markdown file.
- It's fine to replace art in the book, but all artists should remain in the artists' example file, 'artists.md'.
- You're awesome!

# Suggestions

Whether you're making art or not, this is the place to write suggestions for images.

## The Comic Book

Getting comic strips images, perhaps similar to Elf Quest, could provide more depth to the story as the rules move along.  Of course this would imply the existing story with Arneson, Thenton and Hugi is heavily modified or scrapped entirely.
