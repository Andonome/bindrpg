Sean's mind was racing -- searching for anything to help he remembered his acting classes, the roar they taught to open a grand scene and how actors said their roar was such that it would terrify local ruffians around the town.

Sean's player asks the \gls{gm} about making a moral check for the hobgoblins.

``Well'', she ponders, ``you certainly don't outnumber them.
They are not half dead.
They might make a moral check at \gls{tn} 4 but they would get a +1 bonus for their Combat Skill.
So no, not really.
They are not terrified of Sean waving his sword about, even if he took acting classes''.

So much for that plan.
